## Application Features

A todo list web application that allow users to manage the status of their tasks.

### Requirements

- Simple to use interface.
- Tasks can be added, edited, deleted, or marked as complete.
- Tasks with different status can be filtered from the list.
- Created tasks need to be stored in local storage so reloading web page will not remove them.
- Application layout is responsive.
